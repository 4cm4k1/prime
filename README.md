# Prime

Source code for curricula, assignments, projects, and assessments from my time at [@PrimeAcademy](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy). Each subdirectory was formerly its own repository, but I have since merged them all into this monorepo, preserving the commit history. The code and projects themselves are likely to be out-of-date, incomplete, or lacking documentation, so I intend them to be only a reference.
