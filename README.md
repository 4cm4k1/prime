#Peer jQuery Challenge

In this challenge you will be creating an application that will be doing some pretty simple addition. But wait, there's more. The buttons should be appended to screen via jQuery code in your JavaScript file. Your code should hold a varilable `numOfButtons` and that will drive how many buttons show on the screen. You should be able to first click a button (say for instance, the '1' button) and then another (say the '3' button) and below the buttons we should see the equation:

		1 + 3 = 4
		
As the action is repeated, everything should be cleared and reset. This would happen starting with any proceeding button click.
