# Gif_Gen

Today you will use jQuery's ajax function to create a random GIF (not like the peanut butter) generator!

Information and examples about the API can be found here: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI

You application should have an HTML page with a button on it, when the button is clicked it should retrieve a random GIF from Giphy and append it to the screen.

##Hard Mode

Include text input to add tags to your random generation (see docs).

## Pro Mode

Allow normal (non-random) searching and show all results.
