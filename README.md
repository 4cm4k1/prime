# Weekend Challenge

The goal for this weekend is to build a browser-based calculator application using AngularJS.

Create a user interface that resembles a classic calculator, with buttons for the digits 0-9 as well as the four basic operators `+ - * /`.

Allow the user to select a number, an operator and another number. Then display the result of the calculation to the user on the page. For example, if the user selects `1`, `+`, and `2`, you should compute `1+2` and display the result of `3` to the user.

# Hard Mode
Keep a history of the computations the user has performed and display them in a list on the page.

# (Extremely) Pro Mode
Take a look at the [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)
and [reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) and allow the user to enter multi-term expressions and evaluate them using the correct operator precedence!
