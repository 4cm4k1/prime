# Peer Node Challenge

Create a Node application application (no Express here) that will read in a text file called `numbers.txt` containing numbers seperated by a comma. Your application should output the highest number found, the lowest number found, and the average of all the numbers rounded to the closest whole number. Your application should call a function titled `done` when finish and log a message stating so.
