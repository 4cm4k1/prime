## Changelog
### 1.1 (First Prework Challenge)
* Updated to HTML5/CSS3 spec
  * Added `<meta>` tags to `<head>` for search/sharing
  * Replaced all `<div>` tags with more semantic equivalents, such as `<header>, <main>, <footer>`
  * Added `<link>` to `<head>` for Normalize.css to reset browser presets before loading custom CSS
  * Added `<time>` tags to all dates
  * Changed `<header>` content to a block-displayed unordered list, which better represents the data (email, phone, address, bio)
  * Sorted CSS by hierarchy and into sections to avoid unintentional overrides & to better illustrate what's going on
    * Page-wide defaults
      * Body
      * Headings
      * Links
    * Page layout & specific tweaks
      * Header
      * Main
      * Footer
* Design changes:
  * Removed Bootstrap CSS `<link>` to challenge myself in styling it with a similar design but with my own code
  * *Rewrote entire CSS* from scratch
  * Added subtle `box-shadow` property to the dates to set it apart from the other information
  * Utilized fine-tuned CSS selectors (nested elements, `:last-child` pseudo-selectors, etc.) to get as much done design-wise with as little code as possible
  * Whenever `padding, margin & background` properties appear, shorthand or just one specific piece (*e.g. `padding-left`*) is used
  * Added "Professional Experience" heading to clarify what the subsequent information is
  * Clarified under what license the page is available in the link text
* Added this changelog!
 
Essentially, I was happy with the overall design, so only minor tweaks were made in my re-creation of what the page had looked like with Bootstrap. However, because TypeKit (where I have a subscription) doesn't provide direct links to their web fonts, I could not make any `@font-face` declarations in the CSS, so it remains added via TypeKit's JS.

### 1.0 (Admissions Challenge)
* Initial version
