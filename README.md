1) Iterate through the stringList and produce the following output:
"Months listed are March, April, May"

2) Give me the last element in numList using .length to get the index

3) Iterate through numList and add all of the elements together

4) If the second element in boolList is true, add the first and last elements in numList. Otherwise multiple the second element in numList by itself

5) Iterate through boolList, if the value is true add the equivelent index in numList to 'value'
