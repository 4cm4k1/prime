##Arrays and Strings

1)  Iterate through the stringList and produce the following output:

``Months listed are March, April, May.``

2)  Console log the last element in numList using .length to find the last index

3)  Iterate through numList, output all numbers as single String

4)  Iterate through numList and add all of the elements together and console log the total

5) If the second element in boolList is true, add the first and last elements in numList. Otherwise multiply the second element in numList by itself. Console log the output.

6) Iterate through boolList, if the value is true console log the equivelent index in numList.
