# Solo STI Object Upgrade Challenge

Now that we have a solid STI calculator application, it's time to take advantage of JavaScript Objects.

Refactor this application to change the employee arrays into Employee Objects. You'll need to create a constructor function as well as change all of the array references to use Object properties throughout your code.
