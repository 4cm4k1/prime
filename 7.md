# Day 7: Git!

## Reviewing past Git stuff...

Good habit to run `git status` often just to see what has happened to your files, tracked and untracked, committed, up-to-date or not, etc.

`git add` adds files to track, or if they are tracked and have been modified, adds files to ready to commit stage, or they are "staged." `git commit` commits files. `git commit -a -m` can be used to skip `git add` if the files you want to commit are already tracked.

## Branches and the HEAD

`HEAD` points to the commit or branch (a named commit) that you're checking out (`git checkout <branch>`).

GitHub by default will show the files in your project as they were with the __LATEST__ commit (by default, `HEAD` is looking at the `master` branch, which is the default branch that git makes for your repo).

If you checkout past commits, you're in a `detached HEAD` state. Any commits made here will not affect `master`. They will be a diverging set of commits, with which you can create a branch if you wish to merge with the `master` branch at some point in the future.

`git branch` lists the branches in the repo. `git log` lists a history of commits with commit messages. `git branch <branchName>` creates a new branch, but `HEAD` will remain on branch. Use `git checkout` to look at the new branch you created.

You make a commit to the new branch. The branch and `HEAD` advances in the timeline with the commit, but `master` would stay with the previous commit. Then `git checkout master` will move the `HEAD` back to `master`.

When your branch is ready to merge with `master`, `git checkout master` then `git merge <branch>` to merge them. `master` then "fast-forwards" to the point at which the branch was.

`git pull` is a combo of `git fetch` and `git merge`. `git fetch` just retrieves any new branches (and their commits), but doesn't commit them - git is now simply aware of it locally. A branch or even the `master` branch (from the remote `origin`) will need to use `git merge` to "fast-forward" `master` locally.

`git pull` should be avoided if you have modified files on the local repo.
