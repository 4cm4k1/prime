# Solo API Challenge

In this challenge we will be using the OMDb API to create a web page displaying your top 3 movies. You should make 3 queries to the OMDb API for each of your movies and append them to your screen. Each movie entry should use at least 3 keys from the returned data (one being the image). Your page should be styled with CSS and look presentable.

Here is a sample URL: http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Sneakers&y=&plot=short&r=json

Here is a sample JSON return:
