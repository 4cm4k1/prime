# Day 5: DOM, jQuery
## jQuery
Used for traversing the DOM. Originally used to ensure JavaScript worked the same way cross-browser. Also is a huge ecosystem: tons of other plugins (or libraries) that are used in conjunction with jQuery to provide additional functionality.

## DOM (Document Object Model)
The web page that you're looking at. jQuery facilitates accessing and manipulating parts of the DOM.

* Window
	* Document
		* `<div>`
			* `<ul>`
				* `<li>`
				* `<li>`
		* `<div>`
		*	`...`
