## jQuery Walkthrough with Scott

Details are important when reading instructions on projects! Avoid appending long concatenated strings. Separate it out into individual elements/tags to be appended. To save lines of code, assign children().last() to a jQuery variable. Listen for things in containers that already exist in the DOM on load; add a second parameter specific to the thing (which isn't yet in the DOM) you actually want to cause an event. Keep in mind global variables! __Unfortunately, I lost some notes because Chrome got all wacky! :(__

3 functions to make in an application: init, enable, and disable.

## Lectures on Server Architecture

```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var path = require('path');

app.set('port', 5000);

//  ROUTE FUNCTIONALITY
app.get('/*', function(req, res){  //  The whack! (the base URL)
  var file = req.params[0] || '/views/index.html';
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './public', file));
});
//

app.listen(app.get('port'), function(){
  console.log('Listening to port: ' + app.get('port'));
});
```
