# Day 3: JavaScript, Terminal, & GitHub, Oh My!

_January 27: Continuing recap_

## Working on the "speak" proficiency of programming

### Peer challenge

Peer programming is working with 1 peer together (e.g. your neighbor at your desk). 

There are 2 roles: 
* driver (writing code)
* observer (pointer/navigator), they'll suggest improvements, solving the problem

Tends to take 10-15% longer, but results in better code. We'll switch up roles at some point during the exercise.

### Terminal / Command Line / Shell

There's no visual feedback in the terminal, besides the prompt (e.g., `$`). `~ <username>` indicates current directory.

Basic commands:
* `ls				//	Lists what's in directory`
 * `ls -l 			//	Lists contents of directory long-form`
 * `ls -la 			//	Lists ALL contents, including hidden`
 * `pwd				//	Literally print working directory`
 * `cd <path> 		//	Change directory, accepts absolute (globally) and relative paths`
  * `cd /			// 	Goes to root`
  * `cd ~			// 	Goes to home`
  * `cd ..			//	Goes up 1 level in the directory structure (each dot adds 1 more level)`
  * `mkdir <name>	//	Makes new folder with given name`
  * `open <path>	//	Opens path in Finder (GUI)`
  * 

Terminal has autocomplete, so you start typing something, hit tab, and it will try to complete what you want.

/ is root.
~ is home.

Why 1 dash, or 2 dashes?

1 dash is used with multiple commands.

2 dashes are used with a specific command, written out as a word.

You can hit return as much as you'd like!

Hitting the up arrow will cycle through a history of your most recent commands.
