# Day 3: JavaScript recap?

_January 27: Continuing recap_

## Working on the "speak" proficiency of programming

### Peer challenge

Peer programming is working with 1 peer together (e.g. your neighbor at your desk). 

There are 2 roles: 
* driver (writing code)
* observer (pointer/navigator), they'll suggest improvements, solving the problem

Tends to take 10-15% longer, but results in better code. We'll switch up roles at some point during the exercise.
