# Peer Programming Challenge - Javascript - 1
Welcome to your first peer challenge!

In this challenge, you and your partner will program based on a set of instructions you will find inside the JavaScript file. Follow the instructions step by step and it will produce the result that is shown as the final step. Be sure to pay close attention to what the instructions are telling you. 

You will be programming according to the Peer Programming instructions laid out in the Peer Programming lecture. A key point to make again, is that one of you is on the keyboard, programming what the other is telling you to program. As the programmer, if you know that you are on the wrong path, try to allow that moment to be a ‘growth’ moment for your pair. Try to avoid simply making the correction.

There is a specific point in the exercise that you will be required to ‘switch programmers’. Even if you and your pair are in a groove, please make the switch. Getting the other perspective is key in the experience. 

Once you have completed the challenge, make sure to submit your completed project via the method specified by your instructor. Whoever was not the poster in the pair, make sure that you clone that repository and submit your work, too.

Good luck on your first pair challenge. Looking forward to seeing the results!
