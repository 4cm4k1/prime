# Day 2: JavaScript recap

_January 26: Continuing our recap of JavaScript from Day 1_

## From yesterday
```
(function moreMath() {
	console.log('moremath!!');
})();

var myMathFunction = function(numberOne, numberTwo, lastNumber) {	
	return numberOne * numberTwo NaN + 'four' + lastNumber;
}	//	Assigns anonymous function to var myMathFunction, which can be called later

var cat = myMathFunction();	//	Assigns function to var cat

//	var result = doMaths();
// 	if(result > 0) {
//		console.log("Correct!");
//	}
```

## Hoisting & Scoping

Variable declarations are hoisted to the top, setting aside memory for the program to be used later. Assignments are executed in order. Until an assignment is made to the declared variable, its value is `undefined`. 

Function declarations are hoisted to the top as well, but are not executed until called.

Hoisting also occurs within functions with local variables.

The only way to get a new scope (other than global) is to use a function. For example, declared variables within `for` or `while` loops are global, __NOT__ local. Variables declared within these loops are hoisted along with other global variables.

The keyword `var` is used to declare a variable __AND__ hoist it to the top of the current scope. To omit `var` would be to implicitly declare a variable, but it wouldn't be hoisted to the top of the current scope. It is a best practice to always use `var` before declaring variables.

### Example
#### Before:

```
var i;

function moreMath() {
	console.log('moremath!!');
};

console.log('line 22');

var myName = 'Kris';
if(myName == 'Kris') {
	myCat = 'Spot';
}
var myCat = 'Luna';

(function anotherCar() {
	var x = 10;
	console.log('function ran!');
})();

return;

var i;
```

#### After:
```
var i = undefined;
var myName = undefined;
var myCat = undefined;

function moreMath() {
	console.log('moremath!!');
};

var myName = 'Kris';	//	From undefined
var myCat = 'Luna';		// 	From undefined

return;					//	Ends execution

var i;
```

## Arrays

```
var cat = ['Luna', 'Taffy', 'Rambo'];

for(var i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
	console.log(cats[i]);
}

var second = [];
second[0] = cats[0];
```

Indices of an array start at 0. Think of it as the distance that an entry in the array is from the first entry of the array. Arrays can be passed into functions/loops. Each entry of an array is accessed using a `var i`, for example, in the initialization of the loop and referencing it with `<arrayName>[i]` within the loop.

You can put arrays within arrays within arrays within arrays! :D (But don't, lol!) Functions could technically be stored within a variable, but probably wouldn't happen.

## Built-Ins

Variables, objects, and functions are all inherently part of JavaScript. JavaScript also comes with a bunch of built-in helper functions.

Some common ones:
* Numbers
** `Number('747');		//	Converts argument to number`
** `parseFloat('902.59');//	Converts argument (including floating point numbers) to number`
** `parseInt(894.22);	//	Converts argument to number, truncating decimal`
* Strings
** `String(989);			//	Converts argument to string`
** `num.toString();		//	Converts variable (called) to string`
** `str.charAt(1);		//	Retrieves character at index # of string variable`
** `str.substring(7,13);	//	Retrieves characters starting at, between & ending at 2 indicies passed in as arguments`
** `txt.split(',');		//	Splits a string at every character that matches the argument passed in`
* Arrays
** `var fruits = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango'];`
** `fruits.push('Kiwi');		//	Adds an entry at the end of the array`
** `fruits.pop();				//	Removes the entry at the end of the array and returns it`
** `fruits.shift();				//	Removes the entry at the beginning of the array and returns it`
** `fruits.unshift();			//	Adds an entry at the beginning of the array`
