# Day 4: Objects, Switches, JavaScript Style
_January 28_

## Objects

Objects can contain numbers, strings, arrays, functions, etc. They are stored to a name within the object. Depending on the value of the name, it's referred to as a property or a method of the object.
Function -> method
Everything else -> property

```
var iota = {
	name: 'Iota',
	inClassDate: '1-25-16',
	color: 'Purple Blue Orange Fuchsia',
	students: ['Anthony', 'Remy'],
	'the instructor': 'Kris',
	getStudents: function() {
		var list = '';
		for(var i = 0; i < this.students.length; i++) {
			list += this.students[i] + ', ';
		}
		return list;
	}
};
```

How do you get to / reference an object's properties?

```
var color = iota.color;
```

How do you get to / reference an object's methods?
```
var iotaStudents = iota.getStudents();
```

How do you get to / reference a property with a space in an object? (AVOID THIS!)
```
var kris = iota['the instructor'];
console.log(kris);
```

How to check if an object's property matches passed-in argument?
```
iota.hasOwnProperty('');
```

## Constructors

Just a function. Naming convention dictates that you capitalize it. Creates a Student object in the example below.

```
function Student(first, last, cohort) {
	this.firstName: first,
	this.lastName: last,
	this.cohort: cohort
}
```
